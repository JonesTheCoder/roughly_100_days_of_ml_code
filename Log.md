## Day 0 : September 20 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have setup everything so I can keep the log of my work daily related to ML/RL/VR.

**Thoughts** : Main focus will be on working through complementary courses including Denny Britz's ML/RL repo and Siraj Rival's Move_37. Will use list of tutorials in README for exploratory work.

**Ideas** : At some point it would be cool to integrate Zolfran app with github so you could share working code repositories as ideas... maybe used google colab for this?

**Goals/Things going on** : Organizing research for grad schools and beginning application process. Trying to match programmes/people/disciplines is difficult. I'm hoping by continuing my ML learning and creative production, I'll distill my focus down into something I can fit in a paragraph...

## Day 1 : September 21 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Looking over materials and going over the 2nd problem in DB's DP folder, 'Policy Iteration'. Won't be able to really get into this till Monday so just trying to keep the information from
Silver's lectures in mind for the time being.


**Goals/Things going on** : got doubles at the bar x__x...
